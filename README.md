# Exploratory Data Analysis of Spotify Songs Dataset

## Description
Project consists of using dummy song data to explore trends among 50,000 unique songs. This was largely unguided and a basic demonstration of data analysis techniques in Python. I'm very familiar with SQL and refrained on relying on that knowledge to leverage and become more efficient with Python.

## Data Overview
- **Dataset:** Spotify Songs Dataset  
- **Rows:** 50,000  
- **Columns:** 15 (e.g., song name, artist, popularity, duration, release date)  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/refiaozturk/spotify-songs-dataset)

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends.
3. Statistical analysis to find correlations.
4. Insights derived from the analysis.

## Key Findings
- There weren't any notable findings as this data turned out to be a "perfect random" set.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook
