<h1>Spotify Song Data Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

 ### Jupyter Notebook

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using dummy song data to explore trends among 50,000 unique songs. This was largely unguided and a basic demonstration of data analysis techniques in Python. I'm very familiar with SQL and refrained on relying on that knowledge to leverage and become more efficient with Python.
